A discrete Bayesian network modeling the results of a promotion exam within a fire department. The DAG was taken from the referenced paper and the probabilities learned from the associated dataset (the variable Promoted was constructed manually). The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Combine}{The combined score (<70, >=70);}
\item{Oral}{The oral exam schore (<70, >=70);}
\item{Position}{The desired promotion (Lieutenant, Captain);}
\item{Promoted}{Whether an individual obtains a promotion (FALSE, TRUE);}
\item{Race}{(White, Non-White);}
\item{Written}{The written exam score (<70, >=70);}
}
