\title{concrete Bayesian Networks}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network for evaluating the presence probability of blue concrete (Model 2.1 of the referenced paper). Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Basement}{(False, True);}
\item{BlueConcrete}{(False, True);}
\item{BuildingClass}{(Single Family House, MultiFamily House, School Building, Other Building);}
\item{ConstructionYear}{(1930-1955, 1955-1960, 1960-1968, 1968-1975, 1975-1980);}
}
