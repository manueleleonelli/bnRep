\title{Beams Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network assess the structural reliability of bridge systems (Figure 3). Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{BeamWidth}{(Low, High);}
\item{ConcreteStrength}{(Low, High);}
\item{ProbabilityOfFailure}{(Fail, Pass);}
\item{Reinforcement}{(Low, High);}
\item{TempAndHumidity}{(Low, High);}
\item{WaterCementRatio}{(Low, High);}
}
