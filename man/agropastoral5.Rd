\title{Agropastoral Bayesian Networks}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to explore the relationship between social organisation and subsistence strategies. The structure of the BN was given within the referenced paper together with a dataset. Probabilities were learned using the dataset and the discretization mentioned in the paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Community_Organisation}{(Clan communities, Missing, No exogamous clans);}
\item{Community_Size}{(<200, >=200);}
\item{Gathering}{(None, <25, >=25);}
\item{Household_Organisation}{(Small extended, Large extended, Nuclear);}
\item{Settlement_Types}{(Camp, Hamlet, Homesteads, Village);}
}
