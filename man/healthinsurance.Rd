\title{healthinsurance Bayesian Network}
\format{
A conditional linear-Gaussian Bayesian network to predict health insurance charges. The DAG structure was taken from the referenced paper and the probabilities learned from data. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{age}{}
\item{bmi}{}
\item{charges}{}
\item{children}{(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)}
\item{region}{(northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest);}
\item{sex}{(female, male);}
\item{smoker}{(no, yes);}
}
