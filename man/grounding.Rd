\title{Grounding Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to for quantitative analysis of the causation of grounding accidents in Arctic shipping. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper (some information appeared incorrect). The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{BW}{Bad Weather (No,Yes);}
\item{DAM}{Damage (No,Yes);}
\item{DE}{Dependent equipment (No,Yes);}
\item{GRO}{Grounding (No,Yes);}
\item{ICC}{Insufficient communication and collaboration (No,Yes);}
\item{IER}{Imperfect emergency (No,Yes);}
\item{ILC}{Improper labeling of the chart (No,Yes);}
\item{INE}{Inefficient use of navigation equipment (No,Yes);}
\item{IO}{Improper operation (No,Yes);}
\item{IPS}{Insufficient preparation for sailing (No,Yes);}
\item{IRP}{Improper route planning (No,Yes);}
\item{IRR}{Irregularities (No,Yes);}
\item{IS}{Insufficient supervision (No,Yes);}
\item{ISL}{Inconsistent standardization and language (No,Yes);}
\item{ISS}{Insufficient supervision system, rules and regulations (No,Yes);}
\item{IWP}{Insufficient work plan (No,Yes);}
\item{LID}{Limited information dissemination channels (No,Yes);}
\item{LNE}{Lack of navigation equipment (No,Yes);}
\item{LSM}{Lack of safety management system (No,Yes);}
\item{LT}{Lack of training (No,Yes);}
