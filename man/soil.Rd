\title{soil Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network  to display the water treatment impact on soil characteristics. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Depth}{(0-20, 20-40);}
\item{EC}{(Less than 1.4, More than 1.4);}
\item{Intensity}{(Less than 0.3, More than 0.3);}
\item{Length}{(Less than 20, More than 20);}
\item{pH}{(Less than 7.7, More than 7.7);}
\item{W}{(Less than 10, More than 10);}
}
