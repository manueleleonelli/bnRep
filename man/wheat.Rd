\title{Wheat Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network  to predict wheat yield. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{MaximumTemperature}{(Low, Medium, High);}
\item{MeanTemperature}{(Moderate, Other);}
\item{NDVIinMarch}{(Low, Medium, High, Very High);}
\item{Rainfall}{(Dry, Average, Very Wet, Drought and Very Wet);}
\item{Yield}{(Very Low, Low, Average, High, Very High).}
}
