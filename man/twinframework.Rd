\title{Twinframework Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to identify critical factors during the in-service phase and achieve sustainable operation and maintenance for building infrastructures. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Weather}{(Fine weather, Bad weather);}
\item{SocialActivities}{(Active, No activity);}
\item{Time}{(Non-working hours, Working hours);}
\item{CampusActivities}{(Campus activities, No campus activities);}
\item{PersonnelType}{(Student, Social personnel);}
\item{EquipmentStatus}{(Good equipment, Equipment abnormality)}
\item{UsingPlayground}{(Use, Not in use);}
}
