\title{Blockchain Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to predict the probability of blockchain adoption in an organization. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{BA}{Blockchain adoption (Low, High);}
\item{COMPB}{Compatibility (Low, High);}
\item{COMPX}{Complexity (Low, High);}
\item{CP}{Competitive pressure (Low, High);;}
\item{PEOU}{Perceived ease of use (Low, High);}
\item{PFB}{Perceived financial benefits (Low, High);}
\item{PR}{Partner readiness (Low, High);}
\item{PU}{Perceived usefulness (Low, High);}
\item{RA}{Relative advantage (Low, High);}
\item{TE}{Training and education (Low, High);}
\item{TKH}{Technical know-how (Low, High);}
\item{TMS}{Top management support (Low, High);}
}
