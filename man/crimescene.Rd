\title{Crimescene Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to study DNA transfer during lock-picking. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Hypothesis}{(Prosecutor, Defense);}
\item{SuspectCutTheFoil}{(Yes, No);}
\item{SuspectDNAOnFoilFromCutting}{(Yes, No);}
\item{SuspectDNAOnFoilFromPicking}{(Yes, No);}
\item{SuspectPickedLock}{(Yes, No);}
\item{UnknownPickedLock}{(Yes, No);}
\item{UnknownCutTheFoil}{(Yes, No);}
\item{UnknownDNAOnFoil}{(Yes, No);}
\item{DNAFoundOnFoil}{(Suspect DNA On Foil, Suspect And Unknown DNA On Foil, Unknown DNA On Foil, No DNA On Foil);}
