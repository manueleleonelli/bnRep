\title{TBM Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network  to assess the risk of tunnel boring machine jamming. The Bayesian network was learned as in the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Expansive_Surrounding_Rock}{(High, Low, Medium, None);}
\item{Fault_Zone}{(High, Low, Medium, None);}
\item{In.Situ_Stress}{(High, Low, Medium, None);}
\item{Large_Deformation_Surrounding_Rock}{(Serious, Slight);}
\item{Rock_Mass_Classes}{(High, Low, Medium, None);}
\item{Soft.Hard_Interbedded_Rock}{(High, Low, Medium, None);}
\item{TBM_Jamming}{(No, Yes);}
\item{Tunnell_Collapse}{(Serious, Slight);}
\item{Underground_Water}{(High, Low, Medium, None);}
\item{Water.And.Mud_Inrush}{(Serious, Slight);}
}
