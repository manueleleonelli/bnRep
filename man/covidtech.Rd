\title{Covidtech Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to model the relationship between the use of technology and the psychological effects of forced social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bayesian network is learned as in the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{AGE}{Age of respondent (<25, >=25);}
\item{GENDER}{Gender of respondent (Male, Female);}
\item{BELONGINGNESS}{How often the word we is used (Low, Medium, High);}
\item{ANG_IRR}{Perceived level of anger/irritability (Low, Medium, High);}
\item{SOCIAL}{Perceived social support (Low, Medium, High);}
\item{ANXIETY}{Level of anxiety (Low, Medium, High);}
\item{BOREDOM}{Level of boredom (Low, Medium, High);}
\item{LONELINESS}{Perceived loneliness (Low, Medium, High);}
\item{TECH_FUN_Q}{Use of communication technology for fun in quarantine (Low, Medium, High);}
\item{TECH_FUN_PQ}{Use of communication technology for fun pre-quarantine (Low, Medium, High);}
\item{TECH_WORK_Q}{Use of communication technology for work in quarantine (Low, High);}
\item{TECH_WORK_PQ}{Use of communication technology for work pre-quarantine (Low, High);}
\item{OUTSIDE}{Times outside per week (0, 1, >=2);}
\item{SQUARE_METERS}{Home square meters (<80, >=80);}
\item{FAMILY_SIZE}{Number of individuals at home (1, 2, >=3);}
\item{DAYS_ISOLATION}{Days since lockdown (0-10, 11-20, >20);}
\item{REGION}{Region of residence (Lombardy, Other);}
\item{OCCUPATION}{Occupation (Other, Smartworking, Student, Office work);}
