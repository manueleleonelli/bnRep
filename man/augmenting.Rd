\title{Augmenting Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to estimate the probability that the car will remain on track, given its current state and control actions. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{CmdSteeringOnTurn}{(Leaf, Straight, Right);}
\item{CurrentPosition}{(Near, On , Far);}
\item{CurrentSteering}{(Straight, Left, Right);}
\item{CurrentVelocity}{(Slow, Medium, Fast);}
\item{InTrack}{(Yes, No);}
\item{SafeTurnRegion}{(Yes, No);}
}
