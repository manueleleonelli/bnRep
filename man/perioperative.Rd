\title{perioperative Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network for the estimation of the drug suspension period even in the presence of competing risks. The probabilities were available from a repository. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{DrugSuspension}{(0 days, 5 days, 7 days);}
\item{ThromboticRisk}{(High, Medium, Low);}
\item{BleedingRisk}{(High, Null);}
\item{PlateletCount}{(High, Medium, Low);}
\item{AbnormalAPTT}{(High, Medium, Low);}
}
}
\description{
Development of a perioperative medication suspension decision algorithm based on Bayesian networks.
