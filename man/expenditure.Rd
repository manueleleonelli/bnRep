\title{Expenditure Bayesian Network}
\format{
A Gaussian Bayesian network modeling the monthly credit card expenditure of individuals. The code to learn the Bayesian network was given within the referenced paper (Figure 12.c). The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Card}{Whether the application for a credit card was accepted or not;}
\item{Reports}{The number of major derogatory reports;}
\item{Age}{The age in years plus twelfths of a year;}
\item{Income}{The yearly income in $10,000s;}
\item{Share}{The ratio of monthly credit card expenditure to yearly income;}
\item{Expenditure}{The average monthly credit card expenditure;}
\item{Owner}{Whether the person owns their home or they rent;}
\item{Selfemp}{Whether the person is self employed or not;}
\item{Dependents}{The number of dependents + 1;}
\item{Months}{The number of months living at current address;}
\item{Majorcards}{The number of major credit cards held;}
\item{Active}{The number of active credit accounts.}
}
