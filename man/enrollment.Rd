\title{enrollment Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network for sustainable enrollment plan configurations aimed at enhancing the advanced education rate. The probabilities were given in the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{AdvancedEducationRate}{(0, 1);}
\item{AverageAdmissionScore}{(0, 1, 2);}
\item{CoursePassRate}{(0, 1, 2);}
\item{EmploymentRate}{(0, 1, 2);}
\item{FirstTimeGraduationRate}{(0, 1, 2);}
\item{StudentTeacherRatio}{(0, 1, 2);}
\item{TransferRate}{(0, 1, 2);}
\item{EnrollmentQuota}{(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2);}
}
