\title{electrolysis Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to analyze evolving hazard scenarios, such as gas permeation/crossover during proton exchange membrane water electrolysis based on fluid dynamics and electrochemistry of electrolysis. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{C}{Operating current density (High, Low);}
\item{F}{Formation of hazardous H2/O2 gas mixture (Yes, No);}
\item{FPR}{Formation of peroxide radicals which can cause membrane degradation (Yes, No);}
\item{GP}{Gas permeation (Yes, No);}
\item{GRE}{Gas recombiner employed (Yes, No);}
\item{H}{Relative humidity (High, Low);}
\item{HCF}{Hazardous condition formation (Yes, No);}
\item{HOR}{H2 and O2 recombination at catalyst/membrane surface (Yes, No);}
\item{IOA}{Inhibiting oxygen accumulation (Yes, No);}
\item{IRF}{Inhibiting reaching flammability range (Yes, No);}
\item{P}{Operating pressure (High, Low);}
\item{RGP}{Reduction in gas purity (Yes, No);}
\item{SBT}{Surface/bulk treatments of the polymeric membrane (Yes, No);}
\item{SMT}{Sufficient membrane thickness (Yes, No);}
\item{T}{Operating temperature (High, Low);}
\item{V}{Operating cell voltage (High, Low);}
