\title{curacao Bayesian Networks}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to determine land use suitability and potential conflicts for emerging land uses (Tourism BN). The probabilities were given in the referenced paper (input nodes are given a uniform distribution). The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{CoastalView}{(no, yes);}
\item{DistanceToTourismCore}{(distant, nearby, inside);}
\item{ImmediateBeachAccess}{(no, yes);}
\item{NaturalAmenities}{(low, high);}
\item{NeighborhoodSafetyScore}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{ProximityToPOIs}{(far, near, immediate);}
\item{ProximityToSouthernCoast}{(far, near, immediate);}
\item{RoadsWithin1KM}{(no, yes);}
\item{SiteInfrastructure}{(low, high);}
\item{SuitabilityForTourism}{(no, yes);}
\item{UtilityAccess}{(no, yes);}
\item{ViewExtent}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{ViewQuality}{(low, high);}
}
