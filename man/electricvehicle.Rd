\title{Electricvehicle Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to evaluate the risk of electric vehicle fire accidents. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{ACF}{Air conditioning equipment failure (yes, no);}
\item{AM}{Artificial modification (yes, no);}
\item{AWE}{Not aware of early fire (yes, no);}
\item{BEP}{Blocked exhaust pipe (yes, no);}
\item{BF}{Battery failure (yes, no);}
\item{BO}{Battery overcharge (yes, no);}
\item{CBI}{The car body is ignited (yes, no);}
\item{CEF}{Charging equipment fault (yes, no);}
\item{CI}{Collision ignition (yes, no);}
\item{DTH}{Defroster temperature too high (yes, no);}
\item{EC}{Electrical circuit failure (yes, no);}
\item{ECF}{Electronic component failure (yes, no);}
\item{FFE}{The vehicle is not equipped with fire-fighting equipment (yes, no);}
\item{HF}{Human factor (yes, no);}
\item{IS}{Ignition source (yes, no);}
\item{ISC}{Risk of internal spontaneous combustion of electric vehicles (yes, no);}
\item{MMA}{Man made arson (yes, no);}
\item{OFE}{The early open fire was not extinguished (yes, no);}
\item{REI}{Risk of external ignition (yes, no);}
\item{SBB}{(yes, no);}
\item{SCB}{Short circuit in battery (yes, no);}
\item{TLD}{Transmission line damage (yes, no);}
\item{VFD}{Electric vehicle fire disaster (yes, no);}
