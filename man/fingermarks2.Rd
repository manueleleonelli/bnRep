\title{fingermarks Bayesian Networks}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network for the evaluation of fingermarks given activity level propositions. The probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{C1}{Propositions (Hp, Hd);}
\item{C2}{Suspect stabbed the victime with the knife (True, False);}
\item{C3}{Suspect cut food with the knife (True, False);}
\item{C4}{Marks on handle - stabbing (P, F, P_F, P_T, F_T, P_F_T, Undetermined, None);}
\item{C5}{Marks on back - stabbing (P, F, P_F, P_T, F_T, P_F_T, Undetermined, None);}
\item{C6}{Marks on blade - stabbing (P, F, P_F, P_T, F_T, P_F_T, Undetermined, None);}
\item{C7}{Marks on handle - cutting (P, F, P_F, P_T, F_T, P_F_T, Undetermined, None);}
\item{C8}{Marks on back - cutting (P, F, P_F, P_T, F_T, P_F_T, Undetermined, None);}
\item{C9}{Marks on blade - cutting (P, F, P_F, P_T, F_T, P_F_T, Undetermined, None);}
\item{C10}{Findings - Marks on handle (P, F, P_F, P_T, F_T, P_F_T, Undetermined, None);}
\item{C11}{Findings - Marks on blade (P, F, P_F, P_T, F_T, P_F_T, Undetermined, None);}
\item{C12}{Findings - Marks on back (P, F, P_F, P_T, F_T, P_F_T, Undetermined, None);}
