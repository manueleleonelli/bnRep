\title{Conasense Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to support to optimization of the CONASENSE network. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Communication}{(Bandwidth, CoverageArea, Latency, PacketLoss);}
\item{Navigation}{(Accuracy, Mobility, Speed);}
\item{Sensing}{(TransmissionRange, Angle, Uplink);}
\item{Services}{(Good, Moderate, Poor);}
}
