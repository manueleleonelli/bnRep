\title{fluids Bayesian Networks}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to assess the presence of saliva in the recovered material and combine potentially contradictory observations. The network was available from an associated repository. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Risk}{Risk of false positive for saliva detection (High, Low);}
\item{Saliva}{(Yes, No);}
\item{RSID}{Saliva test (Positive, Negative, Weak positive);}
\item{Concentration}{Concentration of total DNA (0-0.0002, 0.0002-0.0005, 0.0005-0.001, 0.001-0.002, 0.002-0.004, 0.004-0.01, 0.01-0.01, 0.02-inf);}
\item{Nature_of_stain}{(Saliva, Fecal matter/vaginal secretion/sperm/breat milk/urine, Other);}
