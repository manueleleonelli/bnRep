\title{covidfear Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to understand the effect of demographic factors on the answers to the COVID-19 fear scale and the relationship between the scale items. The Bayesian network was learned as in the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Age}{(Young, Adult);}
\item{Gender}{(Female, Male);}
\item{Fear}{I am most afraid of COVID-19 (Disagree, Neither, Agree);}
\item{Think}{It makes me uncomfortable to think about COVID-19 (Disagree, Neither, Agree);}
\item{Hands}{My hands become clammy when I think about COVID-19 (Disagree, Neither, Agree);}
\item{Life}{I fear losing my life because of COVID-19 (Disagree, Neither, Agree);}
\item{News}{I become nervous or anxious when watching news and stories about COVID-19 on social media (Disagree, Neither, Agree);}
\item{Sleep}{I cannot sleep because I am worried about getting COVID-19 (Disagree, Neither, Agree);}
\item{Hearth}{My heart races or palpitates when I think about getting COVID-19 (Disagree, Neither, Agree);}
}
