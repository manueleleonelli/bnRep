\title{ADHD Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to classify ADHD symptom. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{ADHD}{ADHD symptom severity (No, Few, Moderate, Risk);}
\item{Carelessness}{Carelessness (Never, Sometimes, Often, Very Often);}
\item{DifficultySustainingAttention}{Difficulty sustaining attention in activities (Never, Sometimes, Often, Very Often);}
\item{DoesntListen}{Doesn't listen (Never, Sometimes, Often, Very Often);}
\item{NoFollowThrough}{No follow through (Never, Sometimes, Often, Very Often);}
\item{CantOrganize}{Can't organize (Never, Sometimes, Often, Very Often);}
\item{AvoidsTasks}{Avoids/dislikes tasks requiring sustained mental effort (Never, Sometimes, Often, Very Often);}
\item{LosesItems}{Loses important items (Never, Sometimes, Often, Very Often);}
\item{EasilyDistractible}{Easily distractible (Never, Sometimes, Often, Very Often);}
\item{Forgetful}{Forgetful in daily activities (Never, Sometimes, Often, Very Often);}
\item{SquirmsAndFidgets}{Squirms and fidgets (Never, Sometimes, Often, Very Often);}
\item{CantStaySeated}{Can't stay seated (Never, Sometimes, Often, Very Often);}
\item{RunsExcessively}{Runs/climbs excessively (Never, Sometimes, Often, Very Often);}
