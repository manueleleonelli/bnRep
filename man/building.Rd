\title{Building Bayesian Network}
\format{
A Gaussian Bayesian network to assess the damage of reinforced concrete structures of buildings. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:

\item{X5}{Cracking state in flexure domain;}
\item{X6}{Shrinkage cracking;}
\item{X7}{Worst cracking in flexure domain;}
\item{X8}{Corrosion state;}
\item{X9}{Weakness of the beam;}
\item{X10}{Deflection of the beam;}
\item{X11}{Position of the worst shear crack;}
\item{X12}{Breadth of the worst shear crack;}
\item{X13}{Position of the worst flexure crack;}
\item{X14}{Breadth of the worst flexure crack;}
\item{X15}{Length of the worst flexure cracks;}
\item{X16}{Cover;}
\item{X17}{Structure age;}
\item{X18}{Humidity;}
\item{X19}{pH value in the air;}
