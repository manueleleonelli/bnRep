\title{Concrete Bayesian Networks}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network for evaluating the presence probability of blue concrete (Model 1.1 of the referenced paper). Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Basement}{(False, True);}
\item{BlueConcrete}{(False, True);}
\item{BuildingClass}{(Single Family House, MultiFamily House, School Building, Other Building);}
\item{FloorArea}{(0-150, 150-220, 220-360, 360-1500, >1500);}
}
