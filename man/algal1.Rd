\title{Algal Bayesian Networks}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to to forecast, in spring, mean total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentration, mean water colour, and maximum cyanobacteria biovolume for the upcoming growing season (May–October) in Vansjø. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{ChiA}{Mean lake chl a concentration - Current (Low, High);}
\item{ChiA_PS}{Mean lake chl a concentration - Previous (Low, High);}
\item{Colour}{Mean lake colour (Low, Medium, High);}
\item{Cyanobacteria}{Mean lake cyanobacterial biovolume (Low, High);}
\item{RainSum}{Precipitation sum (Low, High);}
\item{TP}{Mean lake TP concentration - Current (Low, High);}
\item{TP_PS}{Mean lake TP concentration - Previous (Low, High);}
\item{WindSpeed}{Mean daily mean wind speed (Low, High);}
}
