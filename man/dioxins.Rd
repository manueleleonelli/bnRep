\title{dioxins Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to optimize the use of resources for food safety monitoring. The Bayesian network is learned as in the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{screeningResults}{The results from the screening DR CALUX method (negative, suspect);}
\item{year}{The monitoring year  (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017);}
\item{trimester}{The quarter of the year (1, 2, 3, 4);}
\item{animalSpecies}{The animal species monitored (bovine animal, bovine animal for fattening, broiler, calf for fattening, cow, deer, duck, eel, fishm goat, goose, hen, horse, pig, poultry, rabbit, sheep, trout);}
\item{product}{The food product type (egg, liver, meat, milk);}
\item{sampling place}{The control points (aquaculture, farm, slaughterhouse);}
\item{euMonitoring}{The number of samples analyzed for EU monitoring to estimate background contamination in different products (0, 1, ..., 31);}
\item{gcResults}{The results from the GC/MS method (0, n, p);}
\item{sampleSize}{The number of samples collected during the monitoring period (196, 226, 254, 340, 352, 358, 365, 366, 379, 425).}
