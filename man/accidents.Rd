\title{Accidents Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to provide transport authorities and ship owners with useful insights for maritime accident prevention. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{AccidentType}{(Collision, Grounding, Flooding, Fire/Explosion, Capsize, Contact/Crush, Sinking, Overboard, Others);}
\item{EquipmentDevice}{(Devices and equipment on board operate correctly, Devices and equipment not fully utilised or operated correctly);}
\item{ErgonomicDesign}{(Ergonomic friendly, Ergonomic impact of innovative bridge design);}
\item{FairwayTraffic}{(Good, Poor);}
\item{GrossTonnage}{(Less than 300, 300-1000, More than 1000, NA);}
\item{HullType}{(Steel, Wood, Aluminium, Others);}
\item{Information}{(Effective and updated information provided, Insufficient or lack of updated information);}
\item{Length}{(Less than 100, More than 100, NA);}
\item{SeaCondition}{(Good, Poor);}
\item{ShipAge}{(0,5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, More than 20, NA);}
\item{ShipOperation}{(Towing, Loading/Unloading, Pilotage, Manoeuvring, Fishing, At anchor, On passage, Others);}
\item{ShipSpeed}{(Normal, Fast);}
\item{ShipType}{(Passenger vessel, Tug, Barge, Fishing vessel, Container ship, Bulk carrier, RORO, Tanker or chemical ship, Cargo ship, Others);}
\item{TimeOfDay}{(7am to 7pm, Other);}
\item{VesselCondition}{(Good, Poor);}
\item{VoyageSegment}{(In port, Departure, Arrival, Mid-water, Transit, Others);}
\item{WeatherCondition}{(Good, Poor);}
