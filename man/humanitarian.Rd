\title{Humanitarian Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to assess the country-level risk associated with humanitarian crises and disasters. The Bayesian network is learned  as in the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{RISK}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{EARTHQUAKE}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{FLOOD}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{TSUNAMI}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{TROPICAL_CYCLONE}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{DROUGHT}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{EPIDEMIC}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{PCR}{Projected conflict risk (low, medium, high);}
\item{CHVCI}{Current highly violent conflict intensity (low, medium, high);}
\item{D_AND_D}{Development and deprivation (low, medium, high);}
\item{ECON_DEP}{Economic dependency (low, medium, high);}
\item{UNP_PEOPLE}{Unprotected people (low, medium, high);}
\item{HEALTH_COND}{Health conditions (low, medium, high);}
\item{CHILDREN_U5}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{RECENT_SHOCKS}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{FOOD_SECURITY}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{OTHER_VULN_GROUPS}{Other vulnerable groups (low, medium, high);}
\item{GOVERNANCE}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{COMMUNICATION}{(low, medium, high);}
\item{PHYS_INFRA}{Physical infrastructure (low, medium, high);}
\item{ACCESS_TO_HEALTH}{(low, medium, high);}
