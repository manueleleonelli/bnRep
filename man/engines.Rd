\title{Engines Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to assess the factors contributing to the engine's slow-down processes. The probabilities were given in the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{H1}{Oil mist high density (yes, no);}
\item{H2}{Scavenge air box fire (yes, no);}
\item{H3}{Piston cooling oil non flow (yes, no);}
\item{H4}{Cylinder lube oil non flow (yes, no);}
\item{H5}{Cylinder cooling fresh water low pressure (yes, no);}
\item{H6}{Cylinder cooling fresh water high temperature (yes, no);}
\item{H7}{Main lube oil low pressure (yes, no);}
\item{H8}{Thrust pad high temperature (yes, no);}
\item{H9}{Piston cooling oil high temperature (yes, no);}
\item{H10}{Exhaust gas high temperature (yes, no);}
\item{H11}{Stern tube bearing high temperature (yes, no);}
\item{H}{(yes, no);}
