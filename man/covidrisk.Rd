\title{Covidrisk Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to to investigate how various country risks and risks associated to the COVID-19 epidemics relate to each other. The Bayesian network is learned as in the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{HAZARD}{(low, high);}
\item{VULNERABILITY}{(low, high);}
\item{COPING}{(low, high);}
\item{RISK}{(low, high);}
\item{ECONOMIC}{(low, high);}
\item{BUSINESS}{(low, high);}
\item{POLITICAL}{(low, high);}
\item{COMMERCIAL}{(low, high);}
\item{FINANCING}{(low, high);}
