\title{Diabetes Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements. The Bayesian network is learned as in the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{AGE}{Age (Low, High);}
\item{DIAB}{Test for diabetes (Neg, Pos);}
\item{GLUC}{Plasma glucose concentration (Low, High);}
\item{INS}{2-hour serum insulin (Low, High);}
\item{MASS}{Body mass index (Low, High);}
\item{PED}{Diabetes pedigree function (Low, High);}
\item{PREG}{Number of times pregnant (Low, High);}
\item{PRES}{Diastolic blood pressure (Low, High);}
\item{TRIC}{Triceps skin fold thickness (Low, High);}
}
