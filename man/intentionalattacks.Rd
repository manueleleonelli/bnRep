\title{intentionalattacks Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network modeling a floodgate in the Netherlands. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{X1}{Weak physical access-control (True, False);}
\item{X2}{Sensor data integrity verification (True, False);}
\item{U1}{Lack of physical maintenance (True, False);}
\item{U2}{Well-written maintenance procedure (True, False);}
\item{Y}{Major cause for sensor sends incorrect water level measurements (Intentional Attack, Accidental Technical Failure);}
\item{Z1}{Abnormalities in the other locations (True, False);}
\item{Z2}{Sensor sends correct water level measurements after cleaning the sensor (True, False)}
\item{Z3}{Sensor sends correct water level measurements after recalibrating the sensor (True, False);}
}
