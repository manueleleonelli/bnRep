\title{metal Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to model the uncertainty surrounding the occurrence of a fly-out accident during metal lathe machining operations and its corresponding consequences. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{CAF}{Chuck association fault (Okay, Faulty);}
\item{WHF}{Workpiece holding failure (N-Fail, FLRE);}
\item{TPF}{Tool-post fault (Okay, Faulty);}
\item{CF}{Coolant fault (Okay, Faulty);}
\item{OS}{Operating speed (Proper, Improper);}
\item{SGF}{Safety guards faul (Okay, Faulty);}
\item{IFR}{Wrong feed rate (HR, HE);}
\item{FlyOutAccident}{(Fatal, Major, Minor).}
}
