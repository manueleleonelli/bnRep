\title{Curacao Bayesian Networks}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to determine land use suitability and potential conflicts for emerging land uses (Structural agriculture BN). The probabilities were given in the referenced paper (input nodes are given a uniform distribution). The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{AgriculturalDensity}{(low, med, high);}
\item{AllRoadAccess}{(no, yes);}
\item{BuiltUpDensity}{(low, med, high);}
\item{CoUserInteractionConstraints}{(low, high);}
\item{EnvironmentalConstraints}{(yes, no);}
\item{Geology}{(colluvial clay, diabase or other, limestone bare rock);}
\item{GroundwaterDepth}{(less than 25m, between 25 and 60m, over 60m);}
\item{InfrastructureConstraints}{(low, high);}
\item{ProductivityConstraints}{(low, high);}
\item{SiteConstraints}{(low, high);}
\item{Slope}{(flat, moderate, steep);}
\item{SuitabilityStructuralAgriculture}{(no, yes);}
\item{UtilitiesAccess}{(no, planned, yes);}
