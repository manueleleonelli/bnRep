\item{Baseline_Intention}{(high, medium, low);}
\item{Desensitization}{(high, medium, low);}
\item{Diffused_Responsibility}{(high, medium, low);}
\item{Food_Involvment}{(high, medium, low);}
\item{Future_Intention}{(high_positive, low_positive, neutral, low_negative, high_negative);}
\item{Message}{(gain, nonloss, nongain, loss);}
\item{Perceived_Control}{(high, medium, low);}
