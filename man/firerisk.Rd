\title{Firerisk Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to calculate the probability of fire ignition in buildings (root nodes were given a uniform distribution). The probabilities were available from a repository. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{A1}{Deficient electrical installation (T, F);}
\item{A2}{Bad quality of electical equipment (T, F);}
\item{A3}{Contact between incompatible products (T, F);}
\item{B1}{Mishandling of electrical devices (T, F);}
\item{B2}{Electrical overload (T, F);}
\item{B3}{Power cut (T, F);}
\item{B4}{Degradation of electrical wires (T, F);}
\item{B5}{Excessive heating in the conductors (T, F);}
\item{B6}{Insulation fault (T, F);}
\item{B7}{Short circuit (T, F);}
\item{B8}{Strong intensity electric (T, F);}
\item{B9}{Combustion of electrical equipment (T, F);}
\item{B10}{Appearance of electric arcs (T, F);}
\item{B11}{Appearence of sparks (T, F);}
\item{B12}{Chemical reactions (T, F);}
\item{B13}{Heat release (T, F);}
\item{B14}{Appearance of new products (T, F);}
\item{C1}{Electrical equipment malfunction (T, F);}
\item{C2}{Electrocution (T, F);}
\item{C3}{Fire ignition (T, F);}
\item{C4}{Poisoning (T, F);}
\item{C5}{Asphyxia (T, F);}
\item{C6}{Explosion (T, F);}
