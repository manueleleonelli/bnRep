\title{Foodallergy Bayesian Networks}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to to estimate conditional probabilities of each food allergy when other food allergies are present (full population). Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
\describe{
\item{Cereals}{(T, F);}
\item{Eggs}{(T, F);}
\item{Fruits}{(T, F);}
\item{Milk}{(T, F);}
\item{Nuts}{(T, F);}
\item{Peanuts}{(T, F);}
\item{Seafood}{(T, F);}
\item{Veg_Leg}{(T, F);}
}
