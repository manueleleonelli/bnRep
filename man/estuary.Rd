\title{estuary Bayesian Network}
\format{
A discrete Bayesian network to calculate an Estuary Trophic Index (ETI) score ranging between 0 (no symptoms of eutrophication) to 1 (grossly eutrophic) for estuaries in Aotearoa New Zealand. The probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
