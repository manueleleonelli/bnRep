#' A discrete Bayesian network for the estimation of the drug suspension period even in the presence of competing risks. The probabilities were available from a repository. The vertices are:
#' \describe{
#' \item{DrugSuspension}{(0 days, 5 days, 7 days);}
#' \item{ThromboticRisk}{(High, Medium, Low);}
#' \item{BleedingRisk}{(High, Null);}
#' \item{PlateletCount}{(High, Medium, Low);}
#' \item{AbnormalAPTT}{(High, Medium, Low);}
#'  }
