#' A Gaussian Bayesian network modeling the monthly credit card expenditure of individuals. The code to learn the Bayesian network was given within the referenced paper (Figure 12.c). The vertices are:

#' \item{Reports}{The number of major derogatory reports;}
#' \item{Age}{The age in years plus twelfths of a year;}
