#' A discrete Bayesian network assess the structural reliability of bridge systems (Figure 3). Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{BeamWidth}{(Low, High);}
#'   \item{ConcreteStrength}{(Low, High);}
#'   \item{ProbabilityOfFailure}{(Fail, Pass);}
#'   \item{Reinforcement}{(Low, High);}
#'   \item{TempAndHumidity}{(Low, High);}
#'   \item{WaterCementRatio}{(Low, High);}
