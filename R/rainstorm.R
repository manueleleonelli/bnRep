#' A discrete Bayesian network to  simulate the dynamic change process of scenario deduction. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{EmAct1}{Activate the flood prevention emergency plan; organize emergency rescue teams to garrison key safety points and increase the intensity of inspections; each site is equipped with sufficient special flood prevention materials and equipment (Effective, Void);}
#'   \item{EmAct2}{Improve the level of flood prevention emergency response; organize the maintenance of houses; restrict peopleâ€™s travel; clean up the water outlet in time; and do a good job in popularizing flood prevention emergency measures (Effective, Void);}
#'   \item{EmAct3}{Vigorous dredging of drainage channels, all personnel involved in flood control (Effective, Void);}
#'   \item{EmAct4}{Strengthen inspections and inspections of rivers, reservoirs, geological disasters, urban infrastructure, etc.; force all factories with hidden dangers (enterprises that may have water inlets and hot furnaces, etc.) to stop work and production (Effective, Void);}
#'   \item{EmAct5}{Enterprises continue to close down and add infrastructure (Effective, Void);}
#'   \item{EmAct6}{Arrange professional personnel to guide the dangerous situation of the reservoir on the spot; excavate the drainage trough as soon as possible to reduce the water level, add hydrological stations, and strengthen supervision and early warning (Effective, Void);}
#'   \item{EmAct7}{Extensive excavation of emergency drainage channels; transfer of personnel in hazardous areas; and increase of emergency equipment and medical teams (Effective, Void);}
#'   \item{EmAct8}{Accelerate the transfer of personnel from disaster areas, add high-tech rescue equipment (Effective,Void);}
#'   \item{Scenario1}{Rainstorm (True, False);}
#'   \item{Scenario2}{Precipitation continues to increase (True, False);}
#'   \item{Scenario3}{The ground area is reduced by water (True, False);}
#'   \item{Scenario4}{The weather continued to deteriorate and heavy rainstorms occurred (True, False);}
#'   \item{Scenario5}{Secondary disasters occur (True, False);}
#'   \item{Scenario6}{Heavy rains trigger small floods (True, False);}
#'   \item{Scenario7}{Heavy rains triggered large flooding (True, False);}
#'   \item{Scenario8}{Floods trigger landslides (True, False);}
#'   \item{Scenario9}{All stagnant water is discharged (True, False);}
#'   \item{Scenario10}{The flood disappeared (True, False);}
#'   \item{Scenario11}{The danger was completely controlled and the rainstorm disappeared (True, False);}
#'   \item{Sent1}{Optimistic/pessimistic (Optimism, Gloomy);}
#'   \item{Sent2}{Optimistic/pessimistic (Optimism, Gloomy);}

#'   \item{Sent7}{Optimistic/pessimistic (Optimism, Gloomy);}
#'   \item{Sent8}{Optimistic/pessimistic (Optimism, Gloomy);}
#'   \item{Target1}{The normal living order of the people, and make all the preparations for the deterioration of heavy rains (Attain, Miss);}
#'   \item{Target2}{Ensure that all the water outlets are unblocked, and all the rest are protected at home except for the necessary travel personnel (Attain, Miss);}
#'   \item{Target3}{Water in the ground area is accelerating and decreasing (Attain, Miss);}
#'   \item{Target4}{Ensure that all hidden factories are shut down, avoid other accidents such as explosions, and ensure that all infrastructure is operating normally (Attain, Miss);}
#'   \item{Target5}{The whole society is subordinate to the unified organization of the state (Attain, Miss);}
#'   \item{Target6}{Ensures reservoir danger is under control and casualties continue to decrease (Attain, Miss);}
#'   \item{Target7}{Ensure that the water level is controlled, all personnel in the danger area are evacuated, and there is no increase in the number of casualties (Attain, Miss);}
#'   \item{Target8}{The supply of medical supplies is timely, the efficiency of search and rescue is guaranteed, and the number of casualties is no longer increasing (Attain, Miss);}
