#' A discrete Bayesian network modeling the results of a promotion exam within a fire department. The DAG was taken from the referenced paper and the probabilities learned from the associated dataset (the variable Promoted was constructed manually). The vertices are:
#' \describe{
#' \item{Combine}{The combined score (<70, >=70);}
#' \item{Oral}{The oral exam schore (<70, >=70);}
#' \item{Position}{The desired promotion (Lieutenant, Captain);}
#' \item{Promoted}{Whether an individual obtains a promotion (FALSE, TRUE);}
#' \item{Race}{(White, Non-White);}
#' \item{Written}{The written exam score (<70, >=70);}
#' }
