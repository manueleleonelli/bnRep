#' A discrete Bayesian network to predict if a given short-term time series leads to results similar to those obtained using a long-term time series. Probabilities were given within the referenced paper. The vertices are:
#' \describe{
#' \item{Representativeness}{(Yes, No);}
#' \item{SeriesLength}{(One Year, Two Year, Three Year, Four Year, Five Year, Six Year, Seven Year, Eigth Year, Nine Year, Ten Year, Fifteen Year, Twenty Year);}
#' \item{SeasonalityIndex}{(High, Medium, Low);}
#' \item{RainwaterDemand}{(Demand 20, Demand 30, Demand 40, Demand 50);}
#' \item{AverageAnnualRainfall}{(High, Medium, Low);}
#' \item{AverageNumberOfDryDaysPerYear}{(High, Medium, Low);}
